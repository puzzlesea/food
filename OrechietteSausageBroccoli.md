# Orecchiette with Sausage and Broccoli

- 1 large head fresh broccoli (~1 lb)
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 2 anchovy filets, deboned and roughly chopped
- 1 lb Italian sausages, casing removed
- 3-4 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 1.5 lbs orecchiette
- 2 tbsp grated parmigiano-reggiano + more for serving
- 1/4 cup grated pecorino romano

1. Bring a large pot of water to boil to cook the broccoli and pasta. Cut broccoli into medium sized florets. Peel the stalks and cut into bite-sized pieces. Cook the broccoli in salted, boiling water until just tender.
2. Remove the broccoli from the water. Reserve the water to cook the pasta later.
3. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and add the sausage meat. Sitr and cook until the meat is crumbled and lightly browned. Add red chili flakes and garlic, and cook for another minute.
4. Add the cooked broccoli to the sausage meat with a ladle of cooking water. Stir and cook over low-medium heat until the broccoli breaks apart and forms a sauce.
5. Cook the pasta until al dente. Meanwhile, prepare the anchovies and place them in a small saucepan over the pasta cooking water. Cook the anchovies in a double-boiler fashion until melted into a paste.
6. Add the anchovy paste to the broccoli sauce.
7. Add the pasta to the sauce with a ladle of cooking water and toss.
8. Add the cheeses to the pasta and toss again.
9. Serve with additional parmigiano reggiano on the side.
