# Asparagus Risotto

- 1 bunch asparagus
- 2 onions (a large one and a small one)
- 1L vegetable broth
- Arborio rice
- Peppercorns
- ½ tsp each of dried parsley, sage and thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp + 1 tbsp butter
- ½ cup white wine
- 1 cup parmigiano Reggiano, grated


1.	Wash the asparagus, trim the ends and cut into 1” pieces. Divide into 3 groups: the tougher bottoms, the mid sections and the tips.
2.	Add the broth, the small onion peeled and cut in half, the tough bottoms of the asparagus, the bay leaf and herbs and peppercorns to a medium sauce pan. Bring to a boil and let slowly simmer for 1-2 hours (more is better).
3.	~30 minutes before serving, check the stock and add boiling water if too much water has evaporated during the slow simmer. Add ~1 tsp of salt. Remove the asparagus bottoms if they're still too tough.
4.	Chop the large onion and cook over medium-low heat in the oil and butter in an enameled cast iron pan for ~10 minutes.
5.	Increase the heat to medium and add the Arborio rice. Stir and cook until the rice becomes translucent (~3 minutes).
6.	Increase the heat to medium high and add the white wine. Stir and let the wine evaporate (~90 seconds).
7.	Add the stock by the ladleful to the rice and cook the risotto (~14 minutes). Taste for salt at approximately minute 12.
8.	Turn off heat before adding the last ladle of stock and stir. Add the cheese and remaining tbsp. of butter, stir again, and cover. Let rest ~5 minutes before serving.
