# Veal Scaloppini

- Veal scaloppini
- Olive oil
- Butter
- Flour
- Salt and pepper
- White wine
- Lemon juice


1.	Heat equal amounts of oil and butter in a deep frying pan to almost submerge the scaloppini until hot but not smoking. This oil-butter mixture will be used to make the sauce later.
2.	Season a small amount of flour with salt and pepper. Dry the veal on paper towels and dredge the veal in the flour mixture on both sides.
3.	Working in batches, add the veal in the pan and cook until lightly browned on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip and cook for ~3-5 more minutes. Remove from pan and continue cooking remaining veal.
4.	Once all the veal is cooked, add white wine to the pan to deglaze. Bring to a boil and reduce by half. Add lemon juice to taste.
5.	Add veal back to pan and coat on all sides. Serve immediately with saut√©ed green beans, red, orange and yellow peppers and garlic.
