# Pasta con Polpette

See recipe proportions in spreadsheet with the same name.

## A. Sauce
Make the sauce first:
- 1 lb pork spareribs or neck bones, cut into smaller pieces
- 1 lb veal ribs or osso buco
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried red pepper flakes
- 1.5 tsp kosher salt
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 28 oz cans San Marzano tomatoes

1.	Place a large saucepan over high heat. Add olive oil and brown the pork and veal/beef. Remove the meat from the pan.
2.	Add the onions to the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.
3.	Add the canned tomatoes to the pan, along with the salt, oregano, red pepper flakes and bay leaf. Add the meat to the pan. Bring pan to a boil and reduce heat to a low simmer. Cook for at least 3 hours (4h is good), stirring from time to time.
4.	The sauce is ready when the fat separates from the tomatoes. If needed, remove some of the rendered fat from the sauce and discard (the meatballs will added more fat so err on the side of a leaner sauce).

## B.	Meatballs
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 1 lb medium ground pork
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 4 tbsp grated parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1.5 tsp dried oregano
- 3 tbsp semolina
- 3 tbsp breadcrumbs
- 1.75 tsp salt
- Ground pepper to taste
- Olive oil

1.	In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients and mix thoroughly.
2.	Add enough oil to a frying pan to submerge the meatballs halfway. Working in batches, fry the meatballs, turning halfway through, until browned on all sides.
3.	Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer together for at least 30 minutes.

## C.	Pasta
500g Maccheroni calabrese or Strozzapreti (short pasta seems to match better with meatballs)

1.	Scoop out ~2 ladles of sauce into a separate, larger saucepan for the pasta. Bring to a slow simmer while cooking the pasta.
2.	Cook the pasta in salted water; when done, add the drained pasta to the sauce. Add a ladleful of pasta water if needed.
3.	Serve the pasta topped with meatballs, the pork ribs and veal/beef. Add more parmesan cheese and black pepper.
