# Gratin Dauphinois

- 2 lbs boiling potatoes
- 1 glove peeled garlic, halved
- 1 tbsp butter, softened
- 3 tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 cup grated Emmental or Gruyere cheese
  - The cheese may be omitted, but add 2 more tbsp of cold butter to the potatoes
- 1 cup boiling milk

1. Peel the potatoes. Using a mandolin, slice the potatoes using the thick attachment (1/8" thick). Place in a bowl of cold water until ready to use.
2. Move the oven rack so the baking dish will sit in the upper third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425F.
3. In a large baking dish, rub the garlic clove over the inside of the dish. Grease with 1 tbsp of the butter.
4. Drain the potatoes and dry half of them in a clean dishtowel. Sprinkle half the salt, pepper, cheese and butter over the potatoes. Repeat with the remaining potatoes and seasonings.
5. Place the dish over a burner, and pour the boiling milk over the potatoes. Bring the milk to a simmer, then place the dish in the oven.
6. Bake for ~30 minutes until the milk has been absorbed and the top is browned.
